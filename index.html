          Because of the depth of its culture and the splendor of its surroundings, the Philippines is known<br>
          as Asia's pearl of the Orient. Ancient forts, turn-of-the-century houses, centuries-old churches,<br> 
          and contemporary museums, can all be found there. Philippines is a constitutional republic with a<br> 
          democratically elected president. The president serves as the nation's head, of state, head of<br> 
          government, and chief military commander. A direct election is used to choose the president, who<br> 
          serves a six-year term. The culture of the Philippines is a mix of the traditional Filipino and<br> 
          Spanish Catholic traditions that are mixed with elements from other parts of Asia and America.<br> 
          Filipinos value their families, are frequently religious, and enjoy art, fashion, music, and<br> 
          food. Filipinos enjoy having a good time and are friendly people. Together, people will<br>
          frequently sing, dance, and eat. The annual calendar is jam-packed with celebrations, many of<br>
          which incorporate, pre-Christian nationalism's attire and traditions with modern Catholicism.

        History

        <p class="description">
            People have lived in the Philippines since the dawn of human history. Originally, the various islands<br> 
            were populated by competing tribes, each with their own king or queen. In 1521, the explorer Magellan<br> 
            claimed the islands for Spain and colonization began in 1565. Manila was established as the capital of<br>
            what was then known was the Spanish East Indies in 1571. The Philippine-American war between American<br> 
            soldiers and Filipino revolutionaries lasted from 1899-1902 and resulted in US control of the region,<br> 
            during which literacy increased and freedom of religion was introduced, removing Catholicism’s status<br> 
            as the state religion. America’s promises of independence in 1916 led to the Philippines being granted<br>
            Commonwealth status in 1935. Rizal Park in Manila is one of the most politically significant sites in<br> 
            the Philippines. It was the location for the executions of early revolutionaries, the 1946 declaration<br> 
            of independence, and the 1986 rallies of Marcos and Corazon Aquino that led to the EDSA revolution.
